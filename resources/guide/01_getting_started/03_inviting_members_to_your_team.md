# Inviting members to your Team

Adding members to your team is crucial to share the documentation of your projects with your fellow developers. It's a pretty easy process:

1. Go to your **Team Settings**
2. Scroll down to the **Add Team Member** section
3. Invite your colleagues with their email address. If they are not registered, they will be prompted to register before accessing your team.
