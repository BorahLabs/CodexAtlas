# Introduction to CodexAtlas

CodexAtlas is a tool that automatically generates written and visual documentation of your software projects. It will also handle code updates, so that every time you update your code the documentation will be updated. With CodexAtlas, **documentation is a live reflection of the current code**.

When you [register](/register), we will automatically create a **team** for you. You can think of teams as *companies*. Teams will have different projects, which will have different repositories. If you belong to a team, you can see the documentation for all the projects in that team.
