# Configuring a Team

Once you're inside CodexAtlas, you can click on the **team selector** on the navbar (when you register for the first time, you will see something like "YourName's Team").

Inside the **Team Settings**, you can update the name of your team, as well as the subdomain in which your documentation will be hosted. Only users that belong to your team can access your domain.

Another thing that you can do is to add your own OpenAI key. This will remove some limitations your account might have, and we will use this key for all the requests coming from your account. Bear in mind that you will be charged by OpenAI for your consumption!

Finally, you can read about adding members to your team in the [next chapter](inviting-members-to-your-team).
