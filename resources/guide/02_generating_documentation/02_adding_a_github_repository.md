# Adding a Github repository

## Connecting your Github account

Once your project is setup, you need to connect an account. If you work on GitHub, this is done by adding the CodexAtlas app into your organization.

To do it, access your first project and click on *Add GitHub account*. This will redirect you to the installation page and, once the permissions are given, you will be brought back to add your repository.

If you are connecting the same Github account to multiple teams, please [get in touch](mailto:support@codexatlas.app).

## Adding a Github repository

Github only allows us to access repositories that are public or that you own. When adding a repository, select the account that owns that repository and write the full repository name.
