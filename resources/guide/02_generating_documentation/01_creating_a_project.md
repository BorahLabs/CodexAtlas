# Creating a project

## Structure

CodexAtlas structures your knowledge in a way that is easy to navigate and search. We group it by **projects, repositories and branches**.

Projects are the top-level container for your knowledge. You can think of them as a **group of related repositories**. For example, you can have a project with a repository for the back-end, another one for the front-end and another one for the mobile app.

## Creating a project

To create a project, you can go to your [projects list](/projects). Once there, click on *Create new project*, write a cool name and you're all set!
