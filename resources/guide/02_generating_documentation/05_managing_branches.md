# Managing branches

After adding your repository, Codex will automatically look for the presence of the following branches in your repository, and it will add them automatically:

- `main`
- `master`
- `production`
- `prod`
- `release`
- `dev`
- `develop`
- `staging`

However, from the repository card you can always add more branches to be tracked by Codex:
